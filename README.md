## [Countries and Capitals (Game)](https://vch-sh.github.io/js-countries-and-capitals-game/) 
**Ctrl/Command** + click to open a link in a new window

In this game, you need to match countries with their capitals. By holding down the left mouse button, you can drag and drop options into the corresponding fields. After filling in all the fields, you can check the correctness. At the end of the game, you will see the overall result.

### Developing this project, I practiced the following:
* Drag and Drop API
* Developing a simple slider with different information displayed on different slides
* Working with functions (writing main and auxiliary functions)
* Data attributes
* Conditional styling
