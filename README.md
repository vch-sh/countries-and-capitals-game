This is a simple web-based game that allows players to match countries with their capitals. Players can drag and drop country and capital options to their corresponding places. 

The objective of the game is to correctly match as many countries and capitals as possible to test and improve your knowledge of geography. 

### While developing this game, the following key concepts and techniques were practiced:
* **DOM Manipulation**: The game heavily relies on manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript to create interactive elements, handle drag-and-drop events, and update the game's interface dynamically.
* **Event Handling**: The game utilizes event listeners to respond to user interactions, such as drag-and-drop events and button clicks.
* **Drag and Drop**: Players can drag the country and capital options and drop them into the corresponding boxes in the corresponding sections.
* **Data Attributes**: Data attributes were used extensively in the game to store custom data, including data-rule and data-check, enabling crucial functionalities such as matching countries with their capitals, checking user answers, and providing visual feedback. These data attributes played a vital role in enhancing the game's interactivity and overall functionality.
* **Arrays and Loops**: To manage and iterate over multiple elements, arrays and loops were used. For instance, the game uses arrays to store country and capital elements and loops to perform operations on those elements.
* **Conditional Statements**: Conditional statements were employed to check game conditions, enable/disable buttons, and execute different actions based on user interactions.
* **CSS Styling**: CSS is applied to create an appealing and user-friendly game interface. It includes defining classes, using pseudo-classes for hover effects, and implementing transitions for smooth interactions.
